This 2-day-workshop will be held in Berlin, Germany, on January 22 & 23, 2015. We will use Clojure, a modern programming language, to introduce you to fundamental programming concepts and build a sample app using Clojure.

Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops are all welcome. We'll have different classes separated by experience level.
