== Minimal Install

Clojure requires only http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp[Java] 1.6 or greater, plus the Clojure JAR file itself.

<<xref/../../community/downloads#,Download>> and unzip Clojure. In the directory in which you expanded clojure.zip, run:
[source,clojure]
----
java -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar clojure.main
----
This will bring up a read-eval-print loop (REPL). From the REPL, try:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (+ 1 2 3)
6
user=> (javax.swing.JOptionPane/showMessageDialog nil "Hello World")
----

== Try Clojure Online

* http://tryclj.com/[TryClojure] provides a browser-based Clojure REPL
* http://himera.herokuapp.com/index.html[Himera] provides a browser-based ClojureScript REPL

== Clojure with Leiningen

http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] is a build and project management tool written in Clojure and used pervasively throughout the Clojure community. Follow the instructions there to install Leiningen.

Once it's installed you can start a REPL with:

[source]
----
lein repl
----
